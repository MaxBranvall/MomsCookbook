# Moms Cookbook

Disclaimer: The desktop UI is currently rough around the edges as I mainly focused on writing the mobile UI on this site.

## Tech Stack
- Front-end: Angular
- Back-end: .NET Core REST API
- Database: MySQL

## Features
- Account creation with password reset.
- Admins can add, update, and delete recipes from the site.
- Any visitor can view recipes

## Known issues
 - Desktop site layout as mentioned above
 - Emailed link to reset password does not include base URL. To work around this, append the link included in the email to the URL. For example: https://momscookbook.netlify.app/{EMAILED_LINK_PASTED_HERE_WITHOUT_LEADING_SLASH}
